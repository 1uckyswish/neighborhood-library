# Java Neighborhood library

Welcome to the Neighborhood Library Repository! This project offers a complimentary library service to everyone in your neighborhood, operating on the honor system. Checking out a book is easyâ€”simply enter the book's ID, and you're good to go. The application will keep track of who checks out each book
## Main Class (Home)

This serves as the core of our library project. The Main class coordinates the functionality of all the library's features. Explore the Maven Java folder structure on the left to see how the project is organized.

## Error Handling Section

### Main Class (Home) Error handle

The main screen of the library interface presents users with various options to choose from. It includes error handling to manage instances where users input an option that is not one of the three displayed.

### Error Handling For Checking in a Book Not in Inventory

If a user selects an ID for check-in that is beyond the range of our inventory, an error is triggered indicating that the ID does not exist.

![ErrorHandleWrongID404](https://github.com/1uckyswish/neighborhood-library/assets/107442415/8f643d60-7c19-47d9-8001-4cd51942d836)

### Error Handling For Checking out a Book Already Checked Out

When a user attempts to check out a book using an ID that corresponds to a book already checked out, an error is triggered indicating that the book is currently unavailable for checkout.

![ErrorHandleCheckout](https://github.com/1uckyswish/neighborhood-library/assets/107442415/1b3a0818-4f9a-4135-bc90-b320b2e58fcb)

### Error Handling For Checking out a Book Not Checked Out

If the user attempts to check in a book using an ID that is within the inventory but has not been checked out yet, an error is triggered indicating that the book is still available for checkout.

![ErrorHandleCheckIn](https://github.com/1uckyswish/neighborhood-library/assets/107442415/45109d38-ff7e-43d6-aab3-5e888ef10935)


## Interesting Section of code
### Due Date for Book Returns: 15 Days from Checkout Date

This section of my code is Interesting because it simulates almost real-world library functionality for returning books within a due date. Users are allotted 15 days from the checkout date to return the book. While this piece of code was optional, including this feature enhances the feel of a library system. By using the LocalDate class from Java, I was able to calculate the due date by adding 15 days to the checkout date, providing users with a clear understanding of when their books are due.
